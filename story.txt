Legendary Octo Winner tells the story of an Octopus named Tammy.  Tammy grew up off of
the coast of Cape Verde, but soon learned there was something that set her apart from t
he other octopi she grew up with--she could survive above water. 

Tammy grew up like any other Octopus, swimming around the ocean floor, eating small fish and the occasional seaman, and just having a blast with her octopus friends. Until one day, Tammy was washed up on shore during a storm.

After realizing she could survive outside of the water, she looked up and saw these odd creatures looking at her in awe.  They were all talking and pointing weird devices at her.  Every once in awhile, a strange light would flash from the device and she'd be blinded for a second.   

Tammy tried to say something, but in the eyes of these creatures, she seemed
to be making a bubble show. Some of them started laughing, some started clapping
their hands. Suddenly, a warm hand took away frightened Tammy.

Tammy looked at her rescuer, and it was one of the creatures that had surrounded her, though she could sense that this one was much nicer, much more caring than the others. She couldn't completely comprehend what he was saying, but she felt safe when she read his name tag. "Robert Irwin".
