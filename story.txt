Legendary Octo Winner tells the story of an Octopus named Tammy.  Tammy grew up off of
the coast of Cape Verde, but soon learned there was something that set her apart from t
he other octopi she grew up with--she could survive above water. 

Tammy grew up like any other Octopus, swimming around the ocean floor, eating small fish and the occasional seaman, and just having a blast with her octopus friends. Until one day, Tammy was washed up on shore during a storm.
